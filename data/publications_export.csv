Mar.

The results indicated that Prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes showed a subsurface maximum in warm seasons (spring, summer, and fall) and were abundant at the surface in the cold season (winter). Synechococcus and heterotrophic bacteria exhibited higher cell numbers at the surface and decreased with depth throughout the year. Although not all, some clear diel patterns for picoplankton were observed. Picophytoplankton usually peaked in the nighttime; picoeukaryotes peaked at ~7 to 8 p.m., followed by Synechococcus (peaking at 1 a.m.) and Prochlorococcus (peaking at 2 a.m.). Unlike these picoautotrophs, heterotrophic bacteria could peak either at dusk (i.e., 7 p.m.) or at noon. Seasonally, Prochlorococcus was more abundant in the warm than the cold seasons, while Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes showed blooms in the winter of 2013 and 2011, respectively. Heterotrophic bacteria showed no significant seasonality. Regression analysis indicated that ~73% of the diel-to-seasonal variation of the euphotic zone depth-integrated picophytoplankton biomass (i.e., PicoBeu) could be explained by the changes of the mixed-layer depth (MLD), and this suggested that inorganic nutrient supply could be the major controlling factor in their growth. The strong linear relationship (coefficient of determination, R2 of 0.83, p &amp;lt; 0.01) between sea surface temperature (SST) and PicoBeu implied, for the first time, a potential of using satellite-based SST to trace the biomass of picophytoplankton in the pelagic areas of the northern South China Sea.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.732017,中研院 環變中心,夏復國,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

In the semi‐continuous cultures, the measured 18S rRNA/rDNA ratio ranged from 4.0 × 102 to 5.0 × 103, and the logarithmic form of this ratio increased linearly with the population growth rate under both low nitrogen and low phosphorus conditions. In batch cultures grown under low nitrogen or low phosphorus conditions, log (rRNA/rDNA) also increased linearly with growth rate when the latter ranged between −0.4 and 1.5 day−1. The 18S rRNA/rDNA ratios of Skeletonema sampled from in the southern East China Sea were substantially lower than measured from laboratory cultures.

The results show that, after diatoms, prasinophyte clones are numerically dominant. Within prasinophytes, Micromonas produced the most common sequences, and included clades II, III, IV, and VI. We are establishing the new Micromonas clade VI based on our phylogenetic analysis. Sequences of this clade have previously been retrieved from the South China Sea and Red Sea, indicating a worldwide distribution, but this is the first study to detect clade VI in the coastal waters of Taiwan. The TSA‐FISH results indicated that Micromonas clade VI peaked in the summer (~4 × 102 cells/ml), accounting for one‐fifth of Micromonas abundance on average. Overall, Micromonas contributed half of Mamiellophyceae abundance, while Mamiellophyceae contributed 40% of PPE abundance.

We studied the 1000 km-long mud belt that extends from the mouth of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces of China and ends on the west coast of Taiwan.

The time‐mean net (i.e., integrated from the surface to the bottom) absolute transport increases downstream from 7.3 Sv (±4.4 Sv standard error) northeast of Luzon to 13.7 Sv (±3.6 Sv) east of Taiwan. The observed downstream increase is consistent with the return flow predicted by the simple Sverdrup relation and the mean wind stress curl field over the North Pacific (despite the complicated bathymetry and gaps along the North Pacific western boundary). Northeast of Luzon, the Kuroshio—bounded by the 0 m s−1 isotach—is shallower than 750 dbar, while east of Taiwan areas of positive flow reach to the seafloor (3000 m). Both arrays indicate a deep counterflow beneath the poleward‐flowing Kuroshio (–10.3 ± 2.3 Sv by Luzon and −12.5 ± 1.2 Sv east of Taiwan). Time‐varying transports and velocities indicate the strong influence at both sections of westward propagating eddies from the ocean interior.

Here, we report a time-series investigation of SGD into a tide-dominated coastal wetland, the Gaomei Wetland, located to the south of the Da-Chia River’s mouth, western Taiwan, by using environmental tracers (222Rn, 224Raex, 228Ra, δD, and δ18O). Our results showed that regardless of dry and wet seasons, the 222Rn activities in coastal waters were high at low tide but low at high tide. It represents the continuous input of 222Rn-enriched groundwater. However, the 224Raex and 228Ra activities showed seasonal changes with tide conditions. In the dry season, the 224Raex and 228Ra activities in coastal waters were low at low tide but high at high tide; whereas in the wet season, an opposite relation was observed with quite high 224Raex and 228Ra activities in the low-tide waters. Coupled with the lower δD and δ18O values of coastal and pore waters in the dry season, in comparison to those in the wet season, it is suggested that these phenomena probably reflected a seasonal difference in the main SGD component with fresh SGD in the dry season, but saline ones in the wet season. Based on a 222Rn mass balance model, the estimated SGD fluxes into the Gaomei Wetland varied with tidal fluctuations and ranged from 0.2 to 25 cm d−1 and from 0.1 to 47 cm d−1 for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. A slightly high SGD flux occurring during the wet season at spring tide, implied a stronger tidal pumping coupled with a larger hydraulic gradient between land and sea. In this study, we demonstrated that the variation of SGD into the Gaomei Wetland is not only controlled by the seasonal changes of groundwater recharge, but also by the tidal pumping process.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12061806,臺灣大學,蘇志杰,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

However, biases relating to environments in which corals grew caused concerns. To investigate the anthropogenic carbon signal in the Western Pacific, foraminiferal records in a suite of 13 box cores with good age control were obtained from the continental slope off southwestern Taiwan between 2004 and 2006. δ18O values of planktonic foraminifera (Globigerinoides sacculifer or so-called Trilobatus sacculifer) in collected cores were relatively stable at −2.5‰ to −2‰ in the last century, but foraminiferal δ13C had a gradual secular decline after the 1900s. The decline trend of δ13C began to intensify after the 1960s, and its rate was similar to that observed in the Atlantic. Similar decline trends of δ13C were also found in coral records at regions where the human activity is high (Liuqiu) and low (Dongsha). Our findings indicate that the anthropogenic carbon signal in the Western Pacific was not weaker than that recorded in the Atlantic, and the nearshore sediment can supplement the lack of δ13C records in corals, which are deficient when the environment is not suitable to grow.",https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.795519,中山大學,林慧玲,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

This study examined about 5.1-year continuous mass fluxes in 2013/9-2019/8 and 1.8-year planktonic foraminiferal shell fluxes in 2016/8-2019/8 census from ten and four sets of sediment traps, respectively, moored at the South East Asia Time-series Study (SEATS) site in the northern South China Sea (SCS), the world’s largest marginal sea. A total of four sets of sediment trap mooring with 11 common species were identified, spanning from August 2016 to August 2019 with 8-day and 16-day collecting periods, which provided access to evaluate the impact of the prevailing monsoon system and interannual climatic conditions. Our results show that the winter monsoon enhances the nutrient inventories in the euphotic zone, supporting the productivity and the mass and shell fluxes. In addition to seasonal cycles, the variation of chlorophyll-a concentration in the SCS shows a strong response to wind speed under the influence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The reduction in wind speed and the intensification of Kuroshio intrusion during the ENSO warm phases reduces the productivity and mass and shell fluxes, and vice versa in the case of the ENSO cold phases. The imprint of an ENSO cold phase (La Niña event) in 2017 was signified by 2–3-fold higher values than the 3-year average of total mass and foraminiferal shell fluxes. Instead of the common dominance of Trilobatus sacculifer and Globigerinoides ruber among species composition, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei was the predominant species comprising over 40%–60% of total shells greater than 212 μm. Furthermore, the interval with an elevated abundance of N. dutertrei lasted throughout January 2018 (four collecting intervals). Foraminifera shell fluxes were the lowest during warm months (March-August) in 2019, which was coeval with the increase in proportions of Orbulina universa and Globigerinella calida. The unusual species composition might signify a weak ENSO warm phase (A weak El Niño event) between September 2018 and August 2019.",https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.928115,中山大學,林慧玲,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Seventy-five taxa or morphotypes were identified, with five types of Benthosema pterotum (31.2%), Diaphus slender type (19.9%), Cyclothone alba (7.2%), Diaphus stubby type (5.9%), and Vinciguerria nimbaria (4.4%) being most common during the study period. The hydrographic conditions of the Gaoping waters were likely influenced by large-scale climate change via oceanic physical processes. Apparently higher seawater temperature, mixed layer depth, and lower salinity in the upper 100 m were observed at the end of the strong El Niño events (summer 2016). In addition, the certain dominant taxa exhibited contrasting patterns between El Niño events and regular years. In this study, although the abundance and composition of mesopelagic fish larvae assemblage were not influenced directly by changes in large-scale climatic conditions, the occurrence of mesopelagic fish larvae was related to seawater temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a concentration. We speculated that despite the abundant food availability and the more mesopelagic fish larvae onto the Gaoping waters transported by the increased inflow of the South China Sea Surface Current during El Niño events, the higher temperature and lower salinity at the inshore upper waters might be unsuitable for mesopelagic fish larvae, possibly resulting in low egg and larval survival.",https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse9101065,國立東華大學,謝泓諺,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

We found that the variations in nitrogen fixation rates closely corresponded to Ni availability under HL conditions. The expression of NiSOD and two representative photosynthetic proteins also corresponded to variations in both nitrogen fixation rates and Ni availability under HL conditions. Trichodesmium collected in the field had a high Ni quota and elevated SOD activity. The evidence supports the conclusion that NiSOD protects nitrogen fixation in Trichodesmium from oxidative stress.

Comparable to previous studies, dissolved δ66Zn was relatively low in the top 200 m, ranging from −0.91 to +0.24‰ and increased with depth toward an averaged value, +0.38±0.10‰, in deep water. We found that δ66Zn observed in the deep water of the NWPO was much lower than the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. Box model approaches suggest that spatial variations in the deep water may be attributed to isotopically light Zn originating from sedimentary input or anthropogenic aerosols. In the surface water, the fractionation factors derived from both closed or open system fractionation models are all less than one in the NWPO. However, both closed and open system models show a relatively poor fit to the measured data. We thus propose that external input is a major factor causing the variations of [Zn] and δ66Zn values in surface water, in addition to the effects of scavenging, physical mixing, and biological uptake. As elevated [Zn] and relatively light δ66Zn in the surface water were observed in high aerosol input regions, aerosol deposition may play a dominant role in regulating Zn elemental and isotopic composition in the surface ocean.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019gb006379,中央研究院 環境變遷研究中心,何東垣,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Earth Sci.,2022,2022-5-26,"Marine sedimentary archives are routinely used to reconstruct past environmental changes. In many cases, bioturbation and sedimentary mixing affect the proxy time-series and the age-depth relationship. While idealized models of bioturbation exist, they usually assume homogeneous mixing, thus that a single sample is representative for the sediment layer it is sampled from. However, it is largely unknown to which extent this assumption holds for sediments used for paleoclimate reconstructions. To shed light on 1) the age-depth relationship and its full uncertainty, 2) the magnitude of mixing processes affecting the downcore proxy variations, and 3) the representativity of the discrete sample for the sediment layer, we designed and performed a case study on South China Sea sediment material which was collected using a box corer and which covers the last glacial cycle. Using the radiocarbon content of foraminiferal tests as a tracer of time, we characterize the spatial age-heterogeneity of sediments in a three-dimensional setup. In total, 118 radiocarbon measurements were performed on defined small- and large-volume bulk samples ( ∼ 200 specimens each) to investigate the horizontal heterogeneity of the sediment. Additionally, replicated measurements on small numbers of specimens (10 × 5 specimens) were performed to assess the heterogeneity within a sample volume. Visual assessment of X-ray images and a quantitative assessment of the mixing strength show typical mixing from bioturbation corresponding to around 10 cm mixing depth. Notably, our 3D radiocarbon distribution reveals that the horizontal heterogeneity (up to 1,250 years), contributing to the age uncertainty, is several times larger than the typically assumed radiocarbon based age-model error (single errors up to 250 years). Furthermore, the assumption of a perfectly bioturbated layer with no mixing underneath is not met. Our analysis further demonstrates that the age-heterogeneity might be a function of sample size; smaller samples might contain single features from the incomplete mixing and are thus less representative than larger samples. We provide suggestions for future studies, optimal sampling strategies for quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions and realistic uncertainty in age models, as well as discuss possible implications for the interpretation of paleoclimate records.",https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.871902,Alfred Wegener Institute (Potsdam),Alexandra Zuhr,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The continuous underway pCO2 (i.e., partial pressure of CO2) measurements revealed that surface seawater pCO2 (SS pCO2) displayed spatial variations in response to typhoon passage. The simulated results showed that the mixed-layer deepening after typhoon passage had a minor effect on SS pCO2 variation because pCO2 decrease driven by temperature dropdown and enhanced biological production fueled by nutrients input was largely compensated by pCO2 increase caused by salinity increase and dissolved inorganic carbon input from the subsurface layer. By contrast, the advection pattern showed significant change before and after the typhoon, which could play a major role in controlling the variation of SS pCO2. In the exit area of the cyclonic eddy, SS pCO2 decreased, while in the area of its arrival, SS pCO2 increased. Besides, the discharge of freshwater and the intrusion of the South China Sea subsurface could result in SS pCO2 increase in the nearshore area.

We suggest that this distinct diel pattern in pH and pCO2 could be associated with the enhancement of total alkalinity (TA) production coupled to carbonate sediment dissolution in a semienclosed lagoon. The confinement of the IL may hamper water exchange and seagrass detritus export to the adjacent open ocean, which may result in higher organic matter loading to the sediments, and longer residence time of the water in the IL, accompanied by microbial respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic) that may reduce carbonate saturation level to drive carbonate dissolution and thus TA elevation, thereby forming such a unique diel pattern in carbonate chemistry.

Although coastal areas and estuaries contribute large amounts of global oceanic CH4 emissions, the relative contributions of different sources have not been well determined. The Tamsui River located in northern Taiwan is an urban river flowing through populated cities and thus likely carries large amounts of contaminants, such as nutrients and organic matter to the estuary.

Yet, experimental tests have shown that the effect of VLPs on the bacterial growth rate at different depths has seldom been studied. Bacteria–VLP interaction and the effect of VLPs on bacterial growth rate in the sunlit surface (3 m) and dark, deep ocean (130 m) environments were first explored at a test site in the southern East China Sea of the northwest Pacific. Our experimental results indicated that bacterial and virus-like particle (VLP) abundance decreased with depth from 0.8 ± 0.3 × 105 cells mL−1 and 1.8 ± 0.4 × 106 VLPs mL−1 at 3 m to 0.4 ± 0.1 × 105 cells mL−1 and 1.4 ± 0.3 × 106 VLPs mL−1 at 130 m. We found that the abundance of VLPs to Bacteria Ratio (VBR) in the dark deep ocean (VBR = 35.0 ± 5.6) was higher than in the sunlit surface environment (VBR = 22.5 ± 2.1). The most interesting finding is that in the dark, deep ocean region the bacterial growth rate in the presence of VLPs was higher (0.05 h−1) than that in virus-diluted treatments (0.01 h−1). However, there was no significant difference in the bacterial growth rates between the treatments in the sunlit surface ocean region. Deep-sea ecosystems are dark and extreme environments that lack primary photosynthetic production, and our estimates imply that the contribution of recycled carbon by viral lysis is highly significant for bacterial growth in the dark, deep ocean environment. Further work for more study sites is needed to identify the relationship of VLPs and their hosts to enable us to understand the role of VLPs at different depths in the East China Sea.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13202934,國立臺灣海洋大學,龔國慶,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False

Our analysis of satellite-tracked buoys drifting in the actual ocean demonstrated that accidental drift does not explain maritime migration to this 1200 km-long chain of islands, where the local ocean flows have kept the same since the late Pleistocene. Migration to the Ryukyus is difficult because it requires navigation across one of the world’s strongest current, the Kuroshio, toward an island that lay invisible beyond the horizon.

In the near wake, recirculation occurs with a relative vorticity of ζ ~ 20f (where f is the planetary vorticity) and subsequently sheds at a combination of periods resulting from the tidal oscillations and the intrinsic time scale of eddy evolution. The tidal oscillations are the predominant processes. Our analysis suggests that an island positioned in the Kuroshio with periodic and cross-stream tidal excursions is analogous to a cross-stream oscillating cylinder. Consequently, the shedding period of the vortex is synchronized to a tidal period occurring close to the intrinsic period. The free shear layer, which is characterized by an ~30f relative vorticity band (2 km wide) and a wavy thermal front, develops between the Kuroshio and recirculation. The frontal wave occurring over a time period of 0.5–2 h resembles Kelvin–Helmholtz instability corresponding to high Re values. For the far wake, repeated cross-wake surveys suggest that cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices are alternatively present at a period close to the period of M2 tides in agreement with near-wake measurements. Repeated along-wake surveys reveal a cyclonic eddy shedding downstream at a speed of 0.35 m s−1, 1/3 of the upstream current speed, from the near wake.

Lee, Sen Jan",American Meteorological Society,,2016,2016-10,"This study presents amended procedures to process and map data collected by pressure-sensor-equipped inverted echo sounders (PIESs) in western boundary current regions. The modifications to the existing methodology, applied to observations of the Kuroshio from a PIES array deployed northeast of Luzon, Philippines, consist of substituting a hydrography-based mean travel time field for the PIES-based mean field and using two distinct gravest empirical mode (GEM) lookup tables across the front that separate water masses of South China Sea and North Pacific origin. In addition, this study presents a method to use time-mean velocities from acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) to reference (or “level”) the PIES-recorded pressures in order to obtain time series of absolute geostrophic velocity. Results derived from the PIES observations processed with the hydrography-based mean field and two GEMs are compared with hydrographic profiles sampled by Seagliders during the PIES observation period and with current velocity measured concurrently by a collocated ADCP array. The updated processing scheme leads to a 41% error decrease in the determination of the thermocline depth across the current, a 22% error decrease in baroclinic current velocity shear, and a 61% error decrease in baroclinic volume transports. The absolute volume transport time series derived from the leveled PIES array compares well with that obtained directly from the ADCPs with a root-mean-square difference of 3.0 Sv (1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s–1), which is mainly attributed to the influence of ageostrophic processes on the ADCP-measured velocities that cannot be calculated from the PIES observations.",https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-d-16-0095.1,國立臺灣大學海洋研究所,詹森,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

Here we show the characteristics of interleaving layers observed by a Seaglider with two repeated hydrographic surveys along a triangle track east of Taiwan from December 2016 to March 2017.

Mar. Sci.,2022,2022-5-30,"Swordtip squid (Uroteuthis edulis) is a primary target species of the commercial fishery in the southern East China Sea (ECS), and they normally migrate to a quasi-permanent upwelling zone (called a cold dome) off northeastern Taiwan for spawning and growth during spring (March–May) and fall (October–December) in a year. We examined the connection of the variability in its standardized annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) during 2009–2017 in regard to the physical processes on the southern shelf of the ECS using temperature and wind observations from an isle north of Taiwan (Peng-jia-yu) as well as satellite sea surface temperature and absolute geostrophic velocity. The annual CPUE is positively correlated with the daily temperature anomaly at Peng-jia-yu in the cold dome in October of the previous year and April of the year. A warmer environment favors the recruitment and consequently the catch of the swordtip squid. During the spawning periods of the 9 years, the warm water carried by the Kuroshio frequently intruded atop the cold dome, which benefited the growth of the larvae and consequently helped maintain a certain value of the standardized annual CPUE. The anomalously low CPUE in 2012 and 2016 is attributed to the blocking of the Kuroshio intrusion due to cold and less salty China Coastal Water atop the cold dome in the spring spawning of 2012 and 2016. Based on the velocity strength in the cold dome and in a specified shelf region together with the daily temperature anomaly at Peng-jia-yu, an occupation intensity factor is used to evaluate the dominance of warm Kuroshio water and cold shelf water in the cold dome, which could help predict annual catches.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.900299,臺大海洋所,詹森,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

Laboratory-scale studies at low Reynolds number suggest that high turbulent dissipation occurs primarily within the core region of shear instabilities. However, field-scale studies indicate that high turbulence is mainly populated along the braids of shear instabilities. In this study, a high-resolution, resolving the Ozmidov-scale, non-hydrostatic model with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulent closure is applied to investigate dominant mechanisms that control the spatial and temporal scales of shear instabilities and resulting mixing in stratified shear flow at high Reynolds number. The simulated density variance dissipation rate is elevated in the cusp-like bands of shear instabilities with a specific period, consistent with the acoustic backscatter taken by shipboard echo sounder. The vertical length scale of each cusp-like band is nearly half of the vertical length scale of the internal lee wave. However, it is consistent with instabilities originating from a shear layer based on linear stability theory.

To determine the contribution of the two rivers to pollution, the interaction between river-forced, tide-generating, and monsoon-driven water motions in and around the Mailiao industrial zone harbor was examined by performing a series of numerical model experiments. We used a three-dimensional general circulation model to examine the interplay between Asian monsoon-driven, river-forced, and tide-induced water motions, one of which could primarily affect the plume. The model-derived results for different river discharges revealed that almost all of the ammonium entering the harbor had a slope-positive trend, with oscillations in response to flood–ebb tidal cycles. The ammonium increased with time and flux, except for the 10 m3/s flux. Although the river discharge flux exceeded 200 m3/s, the ammonium entering the harbor was the same as that of the 200 m3/s flux; the ammonium concentration did not increase significantly with time after the flux exceeded 200 m3/s. In addition, irrespective of flood or ebb tidal currents being suppressed by strong Asian monsoons, this mechanism avoided contaminating the water quality of the harbor while northeasterly winds prevailed. By contrast, the southwesterly monsoon drove the geostrophic current northward along the coast; concurrently, the coastal sea level increased to form the surface isobar slope up toward the coast, producing a secondary flow to accelerate geostrophic alongshore currents. The northward geostrophic currents compressed the plumes shoreward, forming a relatively narrow-band plume; the coupling model demonstrated that the southwesterly monsoon-driven current pushed plumes favorably along the west pier into the harbor.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14020152,國立台灣海洋大學,李宏仁,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

Although the distribution of chlorophytes has been widely studied, little is known about how their community composition varies along the coastal-offshore gradient in subtropical continental shelf waters. To better understand their spatial variations, we employed metabarcoding data of 18S rRNA V4 gene to examine chlorophyte composition within the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layers over the continental shelf in the East China Sea (ECS) with high-resolution sampling. Our results indicate a higher chlorophyte diversity in the surface layer than in the DCM.

In more eutrophic waters along the coast and within the DCM layer, chlorophytes were dominated by Mamiellophyceae. A significant spatial variation in community composition occurred along the nutrient gradient in the subtropical continental shelf ecosystem, varying from Mamiellophyceae-dominant in coastal water to Chloropicophyceae-dominant in offshore water. Furthermore, at a low saline coastal station, which had the lowest chlorophyte diversity, Picochlorum (Trebouxiophyceae) was dominant.

The critical value for the occurrence of KH instability in ISWs is evidently 0.25, the canonical criterion of a parallel stratified shear flow. When Ri &gt; 0.25, the turbulent diffusivity Κρ remains O (10−3) m2 s−1 with a standard deviation of one order. When Ri crosses the critical value, the logarithmic turbulent diffusivity linearly increases with a logarithmic reduction in Ri to smooth the velocity and density differences so that Ri is ultimately restored to &gt;0.25. Therefore, the processes of MI cycling preserve ISWs against breakdowns resulting from the uninterrupted growth of KH instability.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2021gl092616,臺灣大學海洋研究所,張明輝,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False

Owing to a full spectrum of anthropogenic activities, the Gaoping waters of southwestern Taiwan are exposed to large quantities of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). However, information on these contaminants in zooplankton in this study area is lacking. In this study, we analyzed 19 PBDE congeners concentrations in 36 zooplankton samples from the Gaoping waters. A high variation in the total PBDE concentrations in zooplankton (from not detected to 1415 ng g−1 dry weight) was found, with the highest PBDE levels being recorded near the entrance of the Kaohsiung Harbor (KH). Significantly higher levels were noted for the KH transect than for the Gaoping River estuary (GR) and Fengshan Township (FS) transects, indicating that PBDE inputs originate from the ocean sewage outfalls. BDE-15 (43%) and BDE-209 (16%) were the predominant PBDE congeners in the zooplankton. Our results suggest that anthropogenic activities might predominantly contribute to significantly high PBDE concentrations. The traditional food web may easily transport these higher levels of PBDEs in zooplankton to higher trophic levels of marine organisms, since the Gaoping waters serve as essential nursery and spawning grounds for invertebrates and fishes.",https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse10121943,國立東華大學,謝泓諺,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Ko, Sen Jan, Magdalena Andres, Anthony Kirincich, Yiing Jang Yang, Jen‐Hua Tai",American Geophysical Union (AGU),JGR Oceans,2020,2020-5,"The processes underlying the strong Kuroshio encountering a cape at the southernmost tip of Taiwan are examined with satellite‐derived chlorophyll and temperature maps, a drifter trajectory, and realistic model simulations. The interaction spurs the formation of submesoscale cyclonic eddies that trap cold and high‐chlorophyll water and the formation of frontal waves between the free stream and the wake flow. An observed train of eddies, which have relative vorticity about one to four times the planetary vorticity (f), is shed from the recirculation that occurs in the immediate lee of the cape as a result of flow separation. These propagate downstream at a speed of 0.5–0.6 m s−1. Farther downstream, the corotation and merging of two or three adjacent eddies are common owing to the topography‐induced slowdown of eddy propagation farther downstream. It is found that the relative vorticity of a corotating system (1.2f) is 70% weaker than that of a single eddy due to the increase of eddy diameter from ~16 to ~33 km, in agreement with Kelvin's circulation theorem. The shedding period of the submesoscale eddies is strongly modulated by either diurnal or semidiurnal tidal flows, which typically reach 0.2–0.5 m s−1, whereas its intrinsic shedding period is insignificant. The frontal waves predominate in the horizontal free shear layer emitted from the cape, as well as a density front. Energetics analysis suggests that the wavy features result primarily from the growth of barotropic instability in the free shear layer, which may play a secondary process in the headland wake.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020jc016123,國立臺灣大學,鄭宇昕,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

The study was derived principally from the spatial and temporal variability of aquatic geochemistry in the river during wet (1999–2000) and drought (2002) periods. The total, physical, and chemical weathering rates in the river basin ranged respectively from 4739, 3601, and 1138 g m−2 year−1 in the wet period to 1072, 656, and 416 g m−2 year−1 in the drought period, resulting mainly from a large difference in rainfall and river discharge between the two periods. The wet and drought periods were likely associated with La Niña and El Niño events, respectively. The weathering rates of the wet period were much higher than those reported from the world’s river basins, showing the unique characteristics of the SMR. The total carbon yield was derived mainly from dissolved inorganic carbon and was much higher in the wet period (140 g C m−2 year−1) than in the drought period (53.7 g C m−2 year−1). Taking silicate weathering (54.7 ± 10.2%) slightly over carbonate weathering (48.6 ± 9.5%) in determining dissolved ion loads, the Kaoping catchment may currently consume 0.155–0.298 MtC/year atmospheric CO2 without considering the CO2 released from chemical weathering. The nutrient yields were controlled mainly by human inputs but also enhanced by increased rainfall. Both regional and local climatic conditions and human impacts likely determined the weathering rates and total yields of carbon and nutrients. The SMRs may collectively contribute significantly to global fluxes of terrestrial sediments, geochemical matters, carbon, and nutrients to oceans.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12187689,,,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Mar. Sci.,2022,2022-11-23,"This study examined the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine the spatial and summer/winter distributions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Taiwan Strait (TS). The hydrological conditions in the TS varied between early summer and winter because of differences in terrestrial input as well as input from the poleward South China Sea Water (SCSW) during the warm summer and the strong, nutrient-rich, equatorward China Coastal Water (CCW) in winter. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 60 to 100 μM-C in early summer and from 70 to 144 μM-C in winter. The average stoichiometric ratio of DOC : DON:DOP was high (353:49:1) in the land-source impacted zones and low (168:21:1) in the SCSW-laden areas, both of which are higher than the Redfield ratio. The concentrations of DOC and nutrients were higher in the western TS (on the coast of China) than in the eastern TS (on the coast of Taiwan), and the highest concentrations were mostly found in the Minjiang River plume, reflecting the profound effects of freshwater input in early summer and CCW inflow in winter. The absorption and emission characteristics of the CDOM varied to a large extent with locations because of the mixing of the shelf water with different source waters. Although the absorption coefficient (aCDOM(325)) and fluorescence intensity of the terrestrial humic-like CDOM (Ft: Ex/Em= 260/400-460) were both strongly inversely correlated with salinity, as an optical tracer, Ft may be more effective than aCDOM(325) in examining the mixing among source waters, given that aCDOM(325) may be subject to various photobleaching effects in the TS. Ft was also significantly correlated with the concentrations of terrestrially derived nitrate and nitrite (N+N) and silicate. The results of factor analysis elucidated the complexity of the hydrological and biological processes that affect the distributions of DOM and CDOM in the TS.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.988340,中山大學,洪佳章 (Jia-Jang Hung),True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False

Environmental changes leading to its extirpation (local extinction) have thus far been elusive. Here, we reconstruct past environmental and oceanic conditions off northwest Taiwan by analyzing clumped isotopes, as well as stable oxygen isotopes, of well-preserved fossil echinoid tests collected from the Toukoshan Formation. Radiocarbon dates suggest that these samples are from Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3). Paleotemperature estimates based on clumped isotopes indicate that fossil echinoids were living in oceanic conditions that range from 9 to 14 °C on average, comparable with the estimate derived for a modern sample from Mutsu Bay, Japan. Notably, this temperature range is ~ 10 °C colder than today’s conditions off northwest Taiwan. The substantially lower temperatures during ~ 30 ka (MIS 3) compared to the modern conditions might be due to the rerouting of surface currents off northwest Taiwan when the sea level was ~ 60 m lower than today, in addition to the cooling caused by a lower atmospheric CO2 level during the Last Glacial Period. Colder waters brought here by the China Coastal Current (CCC) and the existence of shallow subtidal zones termed “Miaoli Bay” (mainly located in the present-day Miaoli county) during MIS 3 plausibly sustained generations of S. mirabilis, yielding tens of thousands of fossil specimens in the well-preserved fossil beds.

As seen in our previous studies in the South China Sea and the Western Philippine Sea, this study concluded that anthropogenic aerosol deposition is the dominant particulate trace metal source in the surface water of the Northwestern Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas. Compared to particulate trace metal composition obtained in other open oceans, we found that the distribution patterns of particulate trace metal composition in the surface waters are closely associated with aerosol deposition fluxes. In regions with low deposition, the particulate trace metal concentrations were extremely low and metal to P ratios were all comparable to their intracellular quota previously proposed. In regions with high deposition, metal to P ratios were highly elevated in comparison to their intracellular quota and metal to Al ratios were deviated from lithogenic ratios to various extents.

Two stations located at the South China Sea (SCS)–KC mixing and the KC waters were chosen for the diel study. In the euphotic zone (~100 m depth), the average values of nitrate (0.97–1.62 μM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a, 0.36–0.40 mg/m3), and primary production (PP; 3.46 ± 1.37 mgC/m3/day) of the mixing water station (MWS) of the two cruises were several folds higher than those of the KC station (KCS; nitrate, 0.03–0.10 μM; Chl-a, 0.14–0.24 mg/m3; and PP, 0.91 ± 0.47 mgC/m3/day). In the July cruise, the maximal bacterial production (BP) at the MWS (3.31 mgC/m3/day) was 82% higher in comparison with that of the KCS (1.82 mgC/m3/day); and the readings of Chl-a showed no trend with BP in the oligotrophic KCS, but a positive relationship was found among these measurements at the mesotrophic MWS. This implies that the trophic status of the system might affect phytoplankton–bacteria interactions. The backward-trajectory analyses conducted by an observation-validated three-dimensional model identified that the prevailing southwest monsoon drove a northeastward “intrusion” of the SCS waters in July 2020, resulted in mixing between SCS and Kuroshio (KC) waters off the east coast of southern Taiwan.

Rarely the influence of far-field internal waves on the river plume dynamics is documented. Our 5-day fix-point measurements and underway acoustic profiling identified hydrodynamic processes on the dispersal pathway of the Pearl River plume. The river plume dispersal was driven by the SW monsoon winds that induced the intrusion of cold water near the bottom. The river effluent occupied the surface water, creating strong stratification and showing on-offshore variability due to tidal fluctuations. However, intermittent disruptions weakened stratification due to wind mixing and perturbations by nonlinear internal waves (NIWs) from the northern South China Sea (NSCS).

Vertical profiling with shipboard lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler and conductivity‐temperature‐depth profiler revealed sizable anomalies in flow and water characteristics in the lee of Green Island. Two different stages of wake evolution were observed from two shipboard surveys. In the first stage, a recirculation developed leeward of the island, followed by a wavy (wave‐like) tail that resembled a weak vortex street. In the second stage, a cold eddy probably originating from the leeward side of the island showed up 14 km downstream of the island. The wake water was colder, saltier, higher in chlorophyll‐a concentration, and produced isopycnal doming up to 60 m. In the recirculation area, the relative vorticity, either positive or negative, was 10 times of planetary vorticity, and the horizontal divergence or convergence was O (10–4 s–1) on average. Flow divergence and convergence in the wake were expected to form upwelling and downwelling zones, producing a vertical circulation that vertically displaces isotherms. High inverse Richardson number, produced by strong vertical shear of horizontal currents, was associated with intense overturning events in the wake. High vertical shear of horizontal currents drove the mixing. The dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy in the overturn regions is O (10–7–10–5) W Kg–1; the corresponding eddy diffusivity is O (10–3–10–1) m2 s–1.

Diamessis",American Geophysical Union (AGU),JGR Oceans,2021,2021-10,"Shoaling internal solitary waves (ISWs) were observed at three mooring sites on the upper continental slope in the northern South China Sea over a period of 5–11 months at water depths of 600, 430, and 350 m. Their properties exhibit a fortnightly variation because of their origination from internal tides. ISW amplitudes, current speeds, and propagation speeds are greater and wave widths narrower in summer than in winter, consistent with the effect of increased stratification in summer, as confirmed by Dubreil‐Jacotin‐Long (DJL) solutions. As ISWs propagate up the slope, the differential response of current and propagation speeds to bottom topography provides an opportunity for convective breaking of ISWs. Convective breaking occurs mostly between 430 and 600‐m depths and exhibits a marginal convective instability status such that (a) the maximum current speed remains nearly equal to the propagation speed and (b) for large‐amplitude waves the current speed and propagation speed decrease at nearly the same rate between 600 and 430‐m depths. The marginal convective instability occurs because ISWs adjust gradually to the gently sloping bottom and preserve their structural integrity after the onset of breaking. Vertical velocity variances behind the leading ISWs, which serve as a surrogate for the number of trailing waves, increase when ISWs reach the convective breaking limit, suggesting that convective breaking may accelerate the fission process in leading ISWs or that convective breaking is accompanied by an enhanced nonlinear dispersion of waves trailing ISWs generated by internal tides.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020jc017129,臺灣大學海洋研究所,張明輝,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

However, studies on them in the Kuroshio, the western boundary current in the North Pacific Ocean, are scarce. To better understand the variations of plankton community respiration (CR) and particulate organic carbon (POC), eight cruises. which covered four seasons over a 2-year period, were surveyed across the Kuroshio at the KTV1 transect east of Taiwan. Spatially, a coastal uplift of isotherms (i.e., onshore lifting and offshore deepening) was observed along the KTV1 transect. During the uplift, the cold and nutrient-rich deep waters shoal to shallow water and enhance phytoplankton growth, resulting in higher values of phytoplankton, POC, and plankton CR on the onshore side. In this study, phytoplankton was dominated by picophytoplankton including Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and picoeukaryotes. Plankton CR was low, and its mean depth-normalized integrated rate (the upper 100 m water depth) ranged from 7.07 to 22.27 mg C m−3 d−1, to which the picophytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria contributed the most. The mean depth-normalized integrated value of POC ranged from 12.7 to 21.6 μg C L−1. POC is mainly associated with phytoplankton biomass with a mean carbon ratio of chlorophyll a/POC ≈ 1.03.

Results show that the intensity of coastal uplift was positively correlated to the flow volume transport of the Kuroshio. Significant dissolved inorganic nutrients were uplifted to the sunlit zone, especially in the onshore. For example, compared to the offshore, nitrate concentration increased 0.49 μM (or ∼178%) in the upper 100 m of the onshore. The increased nutrients thereafter enhanced the growth of phytoplankton; for instance, the Chl a concentration increased 88.3%, compared to offshore, in the upper 100 m of the onshore. Phytoplankton community was mostly composed of picophytoplankton (&amp;lt;2 μm in size), which were dominated, in terms of relative abundance, by Prochlorococcus (83.6%), followed by Synechococcus (13.8%) and picoeukaryotes (2.7%). The relative abundance of Prochlorococcus increased from onshore toward offshore, but the trend was reversed for Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes, which may be affected by the coastal uplift.

To understand how the magnitude of fluvial discharge affects plume ecosystems, particularly organic carbon consumption, data over 10 consecutive summers (2003–2012) were examined in the Changjiang River plume of the East China Sea. The area of the Changjiang River plume ranged from approximately 4.90 × 103 km2 to 94.83 × 103 km2 and varied in proportion to the freshwater discharge rate. Plankton community respiration was at the medium to high end of the values reported for coastal regions. Total organic carbon consumption over the Changjiang River plume was positively correlated with the Changjiang freshwater discharge. This scaling relationship might be associated with river flows delivering allochthonous organic carbon and dissolved inorganic nutrients into the East China Sea. However, plankton community respiration (per m3 basis) decreased as the area of the Changjiang River plume increased; this rate appeared to have been influenced by particulate organic carbon (POC) levels and/or total plankton biomass. Even though POC was dominated by phytoplankton biomass allometrically, bacteria contributed more to plankton community respiration, possibly signifying that these bacteria were more reliant on plankton‐derived organic matter. Even with high phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity, this plume ecosystem was heterotrophic, albeit close to a state of carbon balance. To support high organic carbon consumption, in addition to allochthonous sources from fluvial runoff, a large amount of organic matter might have been autochthonous and derived from plankton in the Changjiang River plume.",https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11729,國立臺灣師範大學,陳仲吉,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Here this interaction is examined with results from a semi‐idealized three‐dimensional numerical model and observations from four pressure‐sensor equipped inverted echo sounders (PIESs) in a zonal section east of Taiwan and satellite altimeters. Both the observations and numerical simulations suggest that, during the interaction of a cyclonic eddy with the Kuroshio, the circular eddy is deformed into an elliptic shape with the major axis in the northwest‐southeast direction, before being dissipated; the poleward velocity and associated Kuroshio transport decrease and the sea level and pycnocline slopes across the Kuroshio weaken. In contrast, for an anticyclonic eddy during the eddy‐Kuroshio interaction, variations in the velocity, sea level, and isopycnal depth are reversed; the circular eddy is also deformed to an ellipse but with the major axis parallel to the Kuroshio. The model results also demonstrate that the velocity field is modified first and consequently the SSH and isopycnal depth evolve during the interaction.

Biodivers.,2022,2022-2,"To understand the spatial species diversity of demersal fish assemblages in Taijiang National Park (TJNP) of Taiwan, fishes from 44 demersal trawl hauls and environmental data were collected in the nearshore and offshore areas of TJNP from April 2016 to May 2019. In total, fishes of 47 families, 84 genera, and 113 species were recorded. The nearshore and offshore demersal fish assemblages in TJNP exhibited significant variability in species composition assessed via beta diversity. Using distance-based redundancy analysis, we demonstrated that bottom depth and substrate type were significant explanatory variables of spatial species diversity and identified three habitat types (I: shallow soft bottom; II: deeper soft bottom; III: deeper bottom with mixed sand and gravel substrates). The nearshore assemblage was characterized by type I, where Tarphops oligolepis (flounder), Trachinocephalus myops (snakefish), and Liachirus melanospilos (carpet sole) dominated in terms of abundance. The offshore assemblage was characterized by either type II or type III because differences in substrate types among sampling sites were noticeable. At the offshore sites characterized by a deeper soft bottom (type II), Johnius distinctus (croaker), Cynoglossus kopsii (shortheaded tonguesole), and Coelorinchus formosanus (Formosa grenadier) predominated. In contrast, the westernmost sampling site, characterized by type III habitat, exhibited relatively high Shannon indices, and Scorpaena miostoma (scorpionfish), Urolophus aurantiacus (sepia stingray), and Parabothus taiwanensis (lefteye flounder) predominated. Our results provide the first baseline information on the environmental characteristics and spatial species diversity of demersal fish assemblages in TJNP and have implications for biodiversity conservation in existing spatial management areas.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12526-021-01225-5,國立中山大學海洋科學系,陳國書,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Groundwater migration can be sensitive to volcanic activities and can induce temporal gravity changes. Here we conducted four gravity measurement campaigns in 2012 with two CG5 relative gravimeters at a total of 31 gravity monitoring sites to probe the spatiotemporal groundwater variability in the TVG area. With careful adjustments to the gravity measurements, the standard point gravity error was approximately 8 μGal on average. The observed gravity changes were compared with the groundwater-induced gravity variations derived from two hydrological models: the continuous flow model that consisted of one permeable layer (Model A) and a dynamic groundwater flow model that used the hydrological solver MODFLOW (Model B). The results show that only gravity observations in the central TVG match the simulated gravity pattern, i.e., the hydrology in the central TVG follows free groundwater flows within the interconnected and porous strata. On the other hand, inconsistencies between simulated and observed gravity changes range from + 40 to – 80 μGal. The discrepancies were located at the eastern and western areas in the TVG and showed opposite variations over time. This pattern of temporal variability cannot be attributed to the use of shallow aquifer models that merely reflect the surface recharges and discharges. We infer that the pattern stems from deep flows, such as hydrothermal fluids alternately replenishing aquifers to the east and west of the TVG, i.e., deep fluid conduits may have developed to the east and west of the TVG and bypassed the central area.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s44195-022-00031-1,台灣大學 海洋研究所,張翠玉,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

Stud.,2013,2013-12,"BackgroundElucidating copepod growth and production rates is important in understanding the trophic role of copepods in marine systems. One of the most commonly used field methods for measuring copepod growth rates is the artificial cohort method.ResultsAn ‘artificial cohort’ is established by limiting the incubated animals to relatively narrow size ranges or developmental stages. Thus, one can measure the change in body weight (BW; attributed to body growth) between the start and conclusion of incubation by following the shift in the biomass distribution. The critical issue here is determining how to describe the biomass distribution before and after incubation in a mathematically concise manner. Traditionally, the mean value of the biomass distribution is used as the representative BW, which assumes that the biomass distribution follows a unimodal distribution. However, in practice, the complex composition of copepod communities can commonly yield observations of multimodal distributions. To overcome this difficulty, we suggest that the representative BW of copepod communities be estimated by multiple-peak consideration instead of using the average value. Specifically, we used a kernel-based approach to determine peak values; as such, only BW values associated with a high frequency were used to determine the representative BW.ConclusionsThrough a comparison of different methods, we show that the multiple-peak consideration yielded a higher proportion of realistic growth rate values. In addition, we noted that growth rates estimated with the multiple-peak method were more closely aligned with predictions based on the metabolic theory of ecology.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1810-522x-52-14,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True

Here, we applied the elements of metacommunity structure framework and the variation partitioning framework to examine whether temporal variation of hydrographic conditions influences bacterioplankton metacommunity dynamics in the southern East China Sea (ECS). The spatiotemporal variation of bacterial communities composition was revealed using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA. In addition to the whole bacterial community, we analyzed four dominant taxonomic groups (Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria) separately. Our analyses indicate that, considering the whole community level, the determinism of metacommunity structure varied among seasons. When the degree of connectivity was low (December), the metacommunity exhibited random distribution and was explained mainly by the environmental component. However, Clementsian metacommunity was found at intermediate connectivity (May), during which the environmental and spatial predictors were both significant. When connectivity was high (August), a random distribution pattern was found and no significant effect of environmental filtering or dispersal limitation was detected. Nevertheless, when considering different taxonomic groups, the differences in metacommunity dynamics among groups were found. Our results suggest that the driving forces of metacommunity dynamics varied depending on hydrography, as the degrees of environmental heterogeneity and connectivity among habitat patches were determined by circulation pattern. Moreover, mechanisms varied among different taxonomic groups, suggesting that differential dispersal capacity among taxonomic groups should be integrated into community assembly studies.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.00986,,,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True

Here, we examine how the size diversity of prey (nano-microplankton) and predators (mesozooplankton) influence trophic transfer efficiency (using biomass ratio as a proxy) in natural marine ecosystems. Our results support previous studies on single trophic levels: transfer efficiency decreases with increasing prey size diversity and is enhanced with greater predator size diversity. We further show that communities with low nano-microplankton size diversity and high mesozooplankton size diversity tend to occur in warmer environments with low nutrient concentrations, thus promoting trophic transfer to higher trophic levels in those conditions. Moreover, we reveal an interactive effect of predator and prey size diversities: the positive effect of predator size diversity becomes influential when prey size diversity is high. Mechanistically, the negative effect of prey size diversity on trophic transfer may be explained by unicellular size-based metabolic constraints as well as trade-offs between growth and predation avoidance with size, whereas increasing predator size diversity may enhance diet niche partitioning and thus promote trophic transfer. These findings provide insights into size-based theories of ecosystem functioning, with implications for ecosystem predictive models.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.2129,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True

To test these hypotheses, we examined 72 phytoplankton assemblage collections in the Kuroshio east of Taiwan. Total phytoplankton biomass was used as a proxy for resource availability instead of nutrients because nutrients are depleted and do not represent resource availability for oligotrophic seas. We found no significant relationship between NBSS slopes with temperature, providing little support for the temperature‐size rule. In contrast, a positive relationship between NBSS slopes and total biomass for most of the year lends general support to the resource‐size relationship, except during the winter and early spring. To explain this exception, we hypothesize that resource pulses occurring during the cold seasons are used more efficiently by small cells and promote faster growth of small relative to large phytoplankton because these pulses take place after a long period of resource depletion in oligotrophic seas; thus, the NBSS slopes become much steeper than would be expected from a positive resource‐size relationship. This deviation can be considered as nonsteady state in terms of phytoplankton size structure relative to resources.

To address this question, we collected small-size (50–200 μm) zooplankton, mesozooplankton (&gt; 330 μm), and larval fish using three different mesh-size (50, 330, 1000 μm, respectively) nets in the East China Sea, and examined their relationships in density.

However, the remote sensing can only reach the ocean surface, the assumption of a PP vertically exponential decrease with increasing depth from the surface to the bottom of euphotic zone may cause a substantial and potential discrepancy between in situ measurements and satellite-based observations of PP. This study compared euphotic zone integrated PP derived from measurements based on ship-based in situ incubation (i.e., PPin situ) and those derived from the satellite-based vertically generalized production model (VGPM; PPVGPM) for the period 2003∼2016 at the South East Asian Time-series Study (SEATS) station. PP values obtained during the NE-monsoon (NEM: Nov∼Mar; PPin situ = 323 ± 134; PPVGPM = 443 ± 142 mg-C m–2 d–1) were ∼2-fold higher than those recorded during the SW-monsoon (SWM: Apr∼Oct; PPin situ = 159 ± 58; PPVGPM = 250 ± 36 mg-C m–2 d–1), regardless of the method used for derivation. The main reason for the higher PP values during the NEM appears to have been a greater abundance of inorganic nutrients were made available by vertical advection. Note that on average, PPin situ estimates were ∼50% lower than PPVGPM estimates, regardless of the monsoon. These discrepancies can be mainly attributed to differences from the euphotic zone depth between satellite-based and in situ measurements. The significantly negative relationship between PP measurements obtained in situ and sea surface temperatures observed throughout this study demonstrates that both methods are effective indicators in estimating PP.

The POC flux associated with the CEs (85 ± 55 mg-C m−2 d−1) was significantly higher than that associated with the WE (20 ± 7 mg-C m−2 d−1).

This was followed by a relative sea-level rise of 120 m and the migration of coastlines landward. As a result, the heads of some paleo-submarine canyons were no longer near river mouths or connected to the shore. Such canyons became inactive due to the lack of terrestrial sediment input. Only 4% of the world’s submarine canyons reach the coastline and remain active today. Among 13 submarine canyons off the shore of Taiwan, we identified seven (n = 7, 54%) that remain connected to the shore and are active during the present-day highstand. The purpose of this study is to determine the key controls of canyon heads that remain connected to the shore with terrestrial sediment input during the Holocene sea-level rise. As a result of high uplift rates, narrow coastal range, steep gradients, frequent earthquakes, and typhoon development in the Taiwan mountain belt, Taiwan has the highest-yield river and sediment supply. This has led to the transportation of large volumes of sediment to the surrounding deep seas.

Downwelling is identified via pronounced warm anomalies under a shallow mixed layer depth, and its dynamics are attributed to negative wind stress curl and current-induced convergence. These findings highlight the important role played by TC-induced downwelling and offer insights for reconsidering the influence of TCs on biogeochemical processes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-51016-0,國立臺灣大學海洋研究所,楊穎堅,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

Earth Sci.,2022,2022-2-10,"By examining bathymetric and seismic reflection data in the shelf-slope region offshore northeast of Taiwan, the morphology of the Huapinghsu Channel/Mienhua Canyon System was refined and the occurrence of axial incision in the major erosional trough of the Mienhua Canyon was identified. The Huapinghsu Channel extends from its head at a water depth of 120 m seaward across the shelf-slope region and merges with the Mienhua Canyon before finally emptying into the Southern Okinawa Trough. This review with a new idea illustrates this channel/canyon system as a sediment conduit transporting sediments from western Taiwan rivers to the Southern Okinawa Trough. Within the proximal reach of the Mienhua Canyon, in situ suspended particles were found associated with bottom nepheloid layers, which transport resuspended particles along the canyon course, and eventually into the Southern Okinawa Trough even during sea-level highstand. The shelf area around the channel head is subject to the influence of frequent occurrences of large typhoons and seasonal migrations of oceanic currents. Numerical examinations indicate that the flow velocities related with large waves or currents satisfy the critical values to the threshold of the motion of fine sand, implying gravity flows occur around the channel head, sweep unconsolidated sediments in the channel head, or even incise the channel floor at the present day. In this paper, sea level changes from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ∼21 ka BP) to the present and sediment input to the head of the Huapinghsu Channel head are considered the major factors in the control of the Huapinghsu Channel/Mienhua Canyon system, which functions as a sediment conduit in the study area. Tectonics and climate are the minor factors that contribute to shelf sediment transport to the Southern Okinawa Trough via this channel/canyon system.",https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.792595,國立自然科學博物館,蔣正興,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

This paper first studies the performance of such systems for current measurements using tomographic inversion approaches to compare with that of a conventional system which distributes the sensors on the periphery of the area of interest. It then proposes two simple signal processing methods for ocean current mapping (using distributed networked sensors) aimed at real-time in-buoy processing. Tomographic inversion generally requires solving a challenging high dimensional inverse problem, involving substantial computations. Given distributed sensors, currents can be constructed locally based on data from neighboring sensors. It is shown using simulated data that similar results are obtained using distributed processing as using conventional tomographic approaches. The advantage for distributed systems is that by increasing the number of nodes, one gains a much more improved performance. Furthermore, distributed systems use much less energy than a conventional tomographic system for the same area coverage.

Mar. Sci.,2023,2023-4-21,"IntroductionBody size regulates all biological processes, including growth, reproduction, metabolism, trophic interactions, etc., and is the master trait across organisms, populations, and communities. Despite a rich literature on the impacts of human and natural disturbances on body size, a clear knowledge gap is the effect of the submarine canyons on the benthic size structures in the deep sea, hindering our understanding of the ecological processes of these dominant ecosystems on the continental margin.MethodsTherefore, we conducted repeated sediment sampling to compare meiofauna and macrofauna biomass body-size spectrum, growth, metabolism, and size composition from a high-energy submarine canyon, Gaoping Submarine Canyon (GPSC), and the adjacent continental slope off SW Taiwan. The GPSC is a dynamic ecosystem connected to a high sediment-yield small mountain river subjected to strong internal-tide energy, swift bottom currents, frequent mass wasting events, and high terrestrial sediment inputs.ResultsWe found that the meiofauna and macrofauna were characterized by relatively larger individuals dominating on the slope to smaller ones dominating in the canyon. As a result, the community biomass, secondary production, and respiration were depressed with distinctive biomass-size composition in the canyon compared to the non-canyon slope. The environmental factors related to internal tide disturbance (i.e., bottom current velocity, duration of sediment erosion, or low light transmission) substantially influence the body size composition of the canyon benthos, while food supplies (i.e., TOC and C/N ratio) and sediment characters (i.e., grain size and porosity) correlated closely with the slope communities.DiscussionWe concluded that the disturbed condition in the GPSC may have wiped out or depressed the local benthic assemblages, and only the smaller, more resilient species could persist. Our results also highlight that the alterations of the canyon benthic community could be a reference to deep-sea ecosystems under anthropogenic disturbances or global climate change.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1122143,國立臺灣大學海洋研究所,魏志潾,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True

Although this system has been the focus of scientific studies for decades, the geological factors controlling gas release are not well understood due to a lack of constraints of the subsurface structure and seepage history. Here, we use high‐resolution 3D seismic data to image stratigraphic and structural relationships associated with fluid expulsion, which provide spatio‐temporal constraints on the gas hydrate system at depth and methane seepage at modern and paleo seafloors. Gas has accumulated beneath the base of gas hydrate stability to a critical thickness, causing hydraulic fracturing, propagation of a vertical gas conduit, and morphological features (mounds) at paleo‐seafloor horizons. These mounds record multiple distinct gas migration episodes between 300,000 and 127,000 years ago, separated by periods of dormancy. Episodic seepage still seems to occur at the present day, as evidenced by two separate fronts of ascending gas imaged within the conduit. We propose that episodic seepage is associated with enhanced seafloor sedimentation. The increasing overburden leads to an increase in effective horizontal stress that exceeds the gas pressure at the top of the gas reservoir. As a result, the conduit closes off until the gas reservoir is replenished to a new (greater) critical thickness to reopen hydraulic fractures.

We developed a rapid method to estimate regional fluid migration rates using an extensive database of seismic reflection profiles taken offshore SW Taiwan. We observe bottom‐simulating reflector (BSR) that deflects toward the seafloor near thrust faults that indicate localized heat flow variations. At these sites, advecting warm pore fluids transport heat to shallower depths and force the BSR shallower. Our 2D steady‐state numerical method quantifies the fluid flow rates required to cause such thermal anomalies. We found that fluid flow rates near the trench of the accretionary wedge range between 0.1 and 16 m3 yr−1 m−1, with slower and faster rates generally associated with slope basin discontinuities and faults, respectively.

We quantified the fluid budget and partitioning of fluid flow between focused discharge through faults and diffusive flow through the wedge. Faults in Taiwan's accretionary wedge capture on average 25% of the total dewatering flux in the younger subduction zone and 38.5% in the tectonically mature collision zone.

Mar. Sci.,2023,2023-1-26,"Dissolved oxygen (DO) and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) were measured at half-hourly intervals from June 29 to September 9, 2019, in a seagrass meadow in the Southeast Asia archipelagos region. The open water mass balance of the O2 approach was used to calculate metabolic rates (i.e., gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (CR), and net community production (NCP). The calculations show that GPP and CR rates in the seagrass meadow of Dongsha Island were approximately 2.5 times higher than the global means (GPP, 507 ± 173 vs. 225 ± 11 mmol O2 m-2 d-1; CR, 497 ± 171 vs. 188 ± 10 mmol O2 m-2 d-1), while NCP was similar to the global mean (8 ± 61 vs. 27 ± 6 mmol O2 m-2 d-1), suggesting that seagrass meadows with high GPP may not necessarily hold high potential for carbon sequestration. The current data set also reveal that NCP tended to increase with GPP only at lower GPP levels, while NCP did not increase with GPP anymore at higher GPP levels. Moreover, the autotrophic/heterotrophic status did not correspond well to the sink/source behavior of CO2, suggesting that organic carbon metabolism could not be the only dominant factor in determining the sink/source status in a typical seagrass meadow underlain by carbonate sediments, which was further supported by the observed decrease in the trend of pCO2 with a relatively stable NCP level over the study period. These results demonstrate that the metabolism and the relationship between NCP and pCO2 in the seagrass meadows of Dongsha Island may deviate greatly from the global mean condition. To obtain a better assessment of the global potential of seagrass meadows as a nature-based solution for carbon sequestration, more regional-specific studies are still needed in the key regions, such as Indonesia and the Pacific archipelagos, that support extensive seagrass meadows but have not been charted.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1076991,國立臺灣海洋大學,周文臣,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

Sci.,2023,2023-4-28,"To understand the process-response relations among physical forcing and biogeochemical properties of suspended particles (SPs) in the river-dominated northern South China Sea shelf, a 5-day shipboard observation was conducted at a fixed location on the dispersal pathway of the Zhujiang (Pearl) River plume (ZRP) in the summer of 2016. Instrumented moorings were deployed near the sampling site to record the flow and wave fields every 10 minutes. Hydrographic properties were measured hourly to identify different water masses. Water and SPs samples at the surface (3 m) and near the bottom (3 m above the bed) were taken every 3 h for the analyses of nutrients, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and particulate organic matter (POM including POC, PN, and δ13CPOC). Meanwhile, the grain-size composition of SPs and seafloor sediment were also analyzed. Results showed that monsoon winds drove cold upwelling and ZRP waters at the surface. Both the upwelling and ZRP regimes contained newly produced marine phytoplankton based on low POC/Chl-a ratio (PC ratio) and enriched δ13CPOC. However, SPs in the ZRP regime were smaller (&amp;lt;153 µm), having denser particle bulk density, and less enriched δ13CPOC, indicating different bio-communities from the upwelling regime. EOF analysis of the surface data suggested that mixing processes and the dispersal of the ZRP regime were mainly controlled by far-field storm winds, tidal modulation, and strength of mixing. On the other hand, a bottom nepheloid layer (BNL) was observed, mainly consisting of SPs&amp;lt;63 μm with higher bulk density than SPs at the surface. POM in the BNL was degraded and δ13CPOC-depleted according to the PC ratio and δ13CPOC. EOF analysis of the near-bottom data indicated that the dominant physical processes influencing the biogeochemical properties of SPs in the BNL were jointly the upwelling-associated lateral transport (first order) and tide-related resuspension (second order). Our study identified the contrast between the surface and near-bottom regimes with the coupling patterns among physical forcing and physiochemical properties of SPs using good constraints on particle dynamics and particle sources.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1156915,中山大學,劉祖乾,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The Taiwan Strait (TS) is a typical shallow conduit region, linking the East and South China Seas. Strong ocean currents, coastal upwellings, distal large rivers, and proximal small mountainous rivers all influence the distribution of OM in the TS. We investigated the covarying patterns in the distribution of gain size classes of sand, silt, and clay; terrestrial-sourced biomarkers (n-C27+29+31 alkanes, n-C26+28+30 fatty acids (FAs), and n-C28+30+32 alkanols); marine-sourced biomarkers (phytoplankton-derived alkenones, brassicasterol, dinosterol, and zooplankton-derived cholesterol) in sea floor sediment; indicator satellite-derived primary production (Chl-a); and water-mass indicator (sea surface temperature, SST). We used an empirical orthogonal/eigen function (EOF) analysis to distinguish the influence of four hypothetical sources that entered the TS through the north, south, west, and east boundaries. Results show that input sources from the south-bound ZMCC (Zhejiang-Fujian Coastal Current) and north-bound SCSWC (South China Sea Warm Current) had the dominant influence on the OM distributions buried in the TS. Input sources via river plumes on lateral boundaries and upwellings in the TS were the secondary factors that affected the sedimentary OM distribution. Within this source-to-sink system of multiple sources and transport processes, silt and clay were the major carriers of the OM signals. Terrestrial biomarkers and primary production (Chl-a) were associated with the two major current systems and river plumes along the edge of TS.

The hydrolytic activity is stimulated by Ca2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and DTT. It is inhibited by Fe2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, EDTA, and PMSF. The SLSP-k is stable in anionic, non-anionic detergents, and solvents. The ability to degrade keratin in chicken feather and hair indicates that this enzyme is suitable for the degradation of poultry waste without the loss of nutritionally essential amino acids which otherwise are lost in hydrothermal processing.

The Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) and Dubreil–Jacotin–Long (DJL) equations supplemented the data from repeated profiling by the glider at a fixed position (depth ∼1017 m) during 19–24 May 2019. The glider-recorded pressure perturbations were used to compute the rarely measured vertical velocity (w) with a static glider flight model. After removing the internal tide–caused vertical velocity, the w of the eight mode-1 ISWs ranged from −0.35 to 0.36 m s−1 with an uncertainty of ±0.005 m s−1 due to turbulent oscillations and measurement error. The horizontal velocity profiles, wave speeds, and amplitudes of the eight ISWs were further derived from the KdV and DJL equations using the glider-observed w and potential density profiles. The mean speed of the corresponding ISW from the PIES deployed at ∼2000 m depth to the T-chain moored at 500 m depth and the 19°C isotherm displacement computed from the T-chain were used to validate the waveform derived from KdV and DJL. The validation suggests that the DJL equation provides reasonably representative wave speed and amplitude for the eight ISWs compared to the KdV equation. Stand-alone glider data provide near-real-time hydrography and vertical velocities for mode-1 ISWs and are useful for characterizing the anatomy of ISWs and validating numerical simulations of these waves.

Significance Statement
Internal solitary waves (ISWs), which vertically displace isotherms by approximately 100 m, considerably affect nutrient pumping, turbulent mixing, acoustic propagation, underwater navigation, bedform generation, and engineering structures in the ocean. A complete understanding of their anatomy and dynamics has many applications, such as predicting the timing and position of mode-1 ISWs and evaluating their environmental impacts. To improve our understanding of these waves and validate the two major theories based on the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) and Dubreil–Jacotin–Long (DJL) equations, the hydrography data collected from stand-alone, real-time profiling of an autonomous underwater vehicle (Seaglider) have proven to be useful in determining the waveform of these transbasin ISWs in deep water. The solutions to the DJL equation show good agreement with the properties of mode-1 ISWs obtained from the rare in situ data, whereas the solutions to the KdV equation underestimate these properties. Seaglider observations also provide in situ data to evaluate the performance of numerical simulations and forecasting of ISWs in the northern South China Sea.",https://doi.org/10.1175/jpo-d-23-0039.1,國立臺灣大學海洋研究所,詹森,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

Our study demonstrated that a shift in the picophytoplankton community composition and grazing activity of predacious nanoflagellates in cold and warm periods can impact on the seasonal dynamics of the microbial food web.",https://doi.org/10.3390/d14010049,海洋大學,蔡安益,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

The growth rates of Synechococcus spp. in the ambient environment were between 0.54 and 0.62 day−1, which were slightly higher than the 0.56 and 0.66 day−1 with nutrient enrichment in summer. In contrast, our nutrient enrichment experiments produced a marked decline approximately from 21% to 58% in the nanoflagellate grazing rate on Synechococcus spp. The reason was that the mixotrophic PNFs directly used the added nutrients and reduced their supply of nutrients from prey during the incubation experiments.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13192686,海洋大學,蔡安益,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

We also compared two methods (linear regression between viral density and time versus arithmetic mean of VP during incubation) of estimating viral production. We found that viral production estimated by linear regression and bacterial mortality by viral lysis were higher during the daytime than during the nighttime. A possible explanation for the high viral production at daytime is that the bacterial community was composed of cell types with higher burst sizes at daytime.

Yet, rate measurements to quantify the contributions of different autotrophic activity types are scarce. Herein, we measured the light and dark dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) uptake rates in the plume water of the Kueishantao hydrothermal field using the 13C‐labeling approach. Seventy percent of the plume‐water samples had chemoautotrophy as the dominant mode of carbon fixation, with the dark DIC uptake rates (up to 18.6 mg C/m3/h) within the range of the primary production in productive inner‐shelf waters. When considered alongside the geochemical and microbiological observations, the rate data reveal the distribution of different trophic activities in the hydrothermal plume. The autotrophic activity at the initial phase of plume dispersal is low. This is explained by the short response time the chemoautotrophs have to the stimulation from vent‐fluid discharge, and the harmful effects of hydrothermal substances on phytoplankton. As plume dispersal and mixing continue, chemoautotrophic activities begin to rise and peak in waters that have low‐to‐moderate Si(OH)4 content. Toward the plume margin, chemoautotrophy declines to background levels, whereas photosynthesis by phytoplankton regains importance. Our results also provide preliminary indication to the loci of enhanced heterotrophy in the plume. Results of artificial mixing experiments suggest that previously formed plume water is the primary source of microbial inoculum for new plume water. This self‐inoculation mechanism, in combination with the intense DIC uptake, helps to sustain a distinct planktonic autotrophic community in this rapidly flushed hydrothermal plume.",https://doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12418,海洋大學,蔡安益,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

In contrast, the reflected waves of the a‐wave remain elusive in shallower waters (&lt;300 m), likely due to interference from their longer incident counterparts.

Based on these environmental parameters, stations were arranged into three groups. Group A represents stations located around Keelung Island with the relative highest average dissolved oxygen, lowest average temperature, and pH values. Instead, the lowest average dissolved oxygen and highest average temperature, salinity, and pH values were recorded at the offshore stations. Keelung Island area was charged by cold water masses, which were driven by the Northeast monsoon, and stations in group C were affected by the Kuroshio Current. Kueishan Island area was mainly affected by mixed water masses resulting from the Kuroshio intrusion and monsoon-derived cold water. In this study, a total of 108 copepod species were identified, with an average abundance of 774.24 ± 289.42 (inds. m−3). Most species belong to the orders Calanoida and Poecilostomatoida, with an average relative abundance (RA) of 62.96% and 30.56%, respectively. Calanoid copepodites were the most dominant group, with a RA of 28.06%. This was followed by Paracalanus aculeatus, with a RA of 18.44%. The RA of Clausocalanus furcatus and Canthocalanus pauper was 4.80% and 3.59%, respectively. The dominant species P. aculeatus, C. pauper, Paracalanus parvus, and Temora turbinata were positively correlated with dissolved oxygen and negatively correlated with temperature in the surface waters. pH showed a negative correlation with P. parvus and T. turbinata, while the temperature was negatively correlated with these two dominant species. Indicator species were selected by an indicator value higher than 50%. Temora turbinata, Calanopia elliptica, C. pauper, Euchaeta concinna, Temora discaudata, Acartia pacifica, Macrosetella gracilis, Corycaeus speciosus, and P. parvus were considered as monsoonal cold water indicator species in Group A. Indicator copepod species for the Kuroshio Current were Farranula concinna, Copilia mirabilis, Candacia aethiopica, Corycaeus agilis, Farranula gibbula and Acrocalanus monachus in the study area.

Ecol. Prog. Ser.,2024,2024-1-11,"The availability of inorganic nitrogen is considered one of the limiting factors for primary production in the ocean. However, different phytoplankton possess unique strategies to take up and assimilate nitrate and ammonium to cope with environmental changes. To investigate the nitrogen uptake characteristics of different size-fractionated phytoplankton in natural assemblages, 3 research cruises were conducted in the southern East China Sea in 2018 and 2019. The nitrogen uptake characteristics of 2 size-fractionated natural assemblages, microphytoplankton (20-200 µm) and pico-nanophytoplankton (&lt;20 µm), were measured using the 15N-tracer technique. At most of the stations, significantly higher potential maximum uptake rates of ammonium than of nitrate were detected in the pico-nanophytoplankton, indicating that small phytoplankton possess a relatively superior capacity to take up ammonium. By contrast, comparing the potential maximum uptake rate for nitrate between microphytoplankton and pico-nanophytoplankton showed that microphytoplankton exhibit a higher capacity for nitrate uptake as a nitrogen source compared to pico-nanophytoplankton. However, repressed uptake rates of ammonium and nitrate in microphytoplankton were sometimes found at the coastal station even when ambient nitrate concentrations remained high. Metatranscriptomic analysis of nitrogen transporter genes in microphytoplankton suggests that most diatoms utilize regenerated ammonium before nitrate to maintain their populations at the end of blooms. Metatranscriptomic approaches identify the transcriptional responses of dominant diatoms to explain how diatoms regulate their nitrogen transporter genes to cope with environmental changes in natural assemblages.",https://doi.org/10.3354/meps14474,國立臺灣海洋大學,康利國,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

The ridge consists of 300 m thick submarine deposits including sediment waves that are manifested as crescentic depressions surrounded by elevated walls on the palaeo‐seafloor.

The instantaneous growth rate of bacteria in seagrass habitats was 2.05 d−1, higher than that of unvegetated water. In a seagrass environment during the summer, we have found that viral lysis and grazing both result in similar mortality rates of bacteria during the summer season.

We attempt to address this issue by deciphering how α-diversity of predator and prey influences each other’s community assembly processes, which subsequently determine their α-diversity. The occurrence of assembly processes was indicated by the mean pairwise taxonomic index within a community (αMPTI), assuming assembly processes left traceable imprints on species’ phylogeny. Specifically, αMPTI quantifies deviations of observed phylogenetic distances from that of random, so that it can be used to hint at the occurrence of non-random/deterministic assembly processes. Larger αMPTI of a community implies the occurrence of weaker homogenizing deterministic assembly processes, which suggests that this community might be comprised of less similar species and thus has higher α-diversity. We hypothesize that higher predator and prey α-diversity would be positively associated with each other’s αMPTI, which would then be positively associated with their α-diversity. To test the hypothesis, we calculated Shannon diversity and αMPTI for heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF; predator) and bacteria (prey) communities in the East China Sea (ECS). The HNF Shannon diversity was found to be positively associated with αMPTI of bacteria, which was then positively associated with bacterial Shannon diversity.

Five upwelling zones of unequal intensity are found around the Taiwan Strait, and the Taiwan Bank (TB) upwelling zone has the most prominent characteristics of low temperature. In this study, satellite images, shipboard ADCPs (acoustic Doppler current profilers), and CTDs (conductivity–temperature–depth measures) were analyzed to investigate the processes of cold water upwelling around the TB shoaling zone. In addition, the MITgcm numerical model and the flexible cubic spline technique were also employed, allowing us to better understand those processes. The model results suggested that a combination of Ekman transport and the centrifugal force, driven by the geostrophic South China Sea Warm Current (SCSWC), constitutes a physical mechanism to contribute the vigorous upwelling in the TB shoal zone. The upwelling is largely driven by Ekman transport. However, the centrifugal force may explain why the upwelling with a crescent-shaped distribution of low temperatures along the convex topography of the southeastern edge of the TB shoaling zone is more prominent than expected, as it tends toward the so-called gradient wind balance. Sudden relaxation of the friction force occurred because of the very sharp shelf break (20–60 m) and steep slope topography; a discontinuous velocity zone around the shelf break could also lead to vigorous cold water upwelling.

Significance Statement
Extensive data concerning the Taiwan Bank (TB) shoaling zone have been collected in the past decade in an attempt to improve understanding of the process of cold water upwelling in the area. Because the Kuroshio invades the South China Sea from the east, and the South China Sea Warm Current flows northeastward around the southeastern edge of the TB, water circulation in and around the sandbar is very complicated. Thus, we expanded our model range from small to large scale to avoid the open boundary settings of small-scale model (including the temperature and salinity fields, wind stress, and the model driving forces), which were not easy to set up. Thus, we used a large-scale, high-resolution circulation model to study a small-scale ocean region. Physical processes of this upwelling can finally be verified in the small-scale region. To compensate for the insufficient resolution of the large-scale numerical model, our strategy was to utilize the flexible cubic spline technique to resolve the curvature of the markedly meandering currents. In light of scale analysis, the results showed that in addition to the critical contribution of Ekman transport to the upwelling, the effects of centrifugal forces on upwelling in the TB shoal zone need to be considered.",https://doi.org/10.1175/jpo-d-21-0201.1,國立台灣海洋大學,李宏仁,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

Two ocean-bottom seismometer networks deployed on the frontal accretionary wedge of the northern Manila trench in 2005 and on the outer slope of the trench in 2006 were used to detect earthquakes in the subducting plate. All available P and S manually picked phases and the waveforms of 16 short-period, three-component stations were used. Relocation was performed using the double-difference method with differential times derived from the phase-picked data. Two intraplate earthquake sequences of small-to-moderate magnitudes in the northern Manila subduction system were investigated in this study. The results revealed distinct fault planes, but a contrasting seismogeny over the northern Manila Trench. The seismicity in the frontal wedge (as measured in 2005) was mainly contributed by a fluid overpressure sequence, whereas that in the incoming plate (as measured in 2006) was contributed by the aftershocks of an extensional faulting sequence. The obtained seismic velocity models and Vp/Vs ratios revealed that the overpressure was likely caused by high pore-fluid pressure within the shallow subduction zone. By using the near-field waveform inversion algorithm, we determined focal mechanism solutions for a few relatively large earthquakes. Through the use of data obtained from global seismic observations, we determined that stress transfer may be responsible for the seismic activity in the study area during the period of 2005–2006. In late 2005, the plate interface in the frontal wedge area was unlocked by the overpressure effect due to a thrusting-dominant sequence. This event changed the stress regime across the Manila Trench and triggered a normal fault extension at the outer trench slope in mid-2006. However, in the present study, a hybrid focal mechanism solution indicating reverse and strike–slip mechanisms was implemented, and it revealed that the plate interface locked again in late 2006.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40623-022-01664-9,台灣大學 海洋研究所,張翠玉,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

These values indicate, within uncertainties and variabilities observed, that the metabolism of the system was in net balance. During months influenced by the stronger northeast monsoon forcing, the system appears to be more dynamic and with variable production rates, which may shift the metabolism to net autotrophy (with NP rates up to ∼ 140 mg C m−2 d−1). Furthermore, our data from the deeper regions show that the SCS circulation is strongly affected by monsoon wind forcing, with a larger part of the water column down to at least 400 m depth fully exchanged during a winter, suggesting the 17Δ of deep O2 as a valuable novel tracer for probing mixing processes.

Above the sill crest, isothermal domes, with vertical scales of ∼20 and ∼50 m during the low and high tides, respectively, are generated by turbulent mixing as a result of shear instability in the bottom boundary layer. Tidally modulated hydraulic character modifies the small-scale processes occurring on the leeward side of the sill. Criticality analysis, performed by solving the Taylor–Goldstein equation, suggests that the observed lee waves and intermediate layer sandwiched by two free shear layers are related to the mode-1 and mode-2 critical control between the sill crest and immediate lee, respectively. Around high tide, lee waves are advected further downstream, and only mode-1 critical control can occur, leading to a warm water depression.

event-driven oceanographic changes in the northern South China Sea (NSCS). The total vertical flux of carbon (TFC) is defined as the sum of active
and passive fluxes of biogenic carbon in the surface layer, which may be considered as the central part of marine carbon cycle. These active and
passive fluxes of N and P were also considered to understand stoichiometric flux patterns and the roles of nutrients involved in the TFC. The
magnitudes of total C, N, and P fluxes were, respectively, estimated to be 71.9–347 (mean ± SD,
163 ± 70) mgCm-2d-1, 13.0–30.5 (21.2.± 4.9) mgNm-2d-1, and 1.02–2.97
(1.94 ± 0.44) mgPm-2d-1, which were higher than most previously reported vertical fluxes in open oceans, likely because a
quarter of the fluxes was contributed from active fluxes that were unaccounted for in vertical fluxes previously. Moreover, the passive fluxes
dominated the total vertical fluxes and were estimated to be 65.3–255 (125 ± 64.9) mgCm-2d-1 (77 ± 52 % of
total C flux), 11.9–23.2 (17.6 ± 4.2) mgNm-2d-1 (83 ± 28 % of total N flux), and 0.89–1.98
(1.44 ± 0.33) mgPm-2d-1 (74 ± 24 % of total P flux). Vertical fluxes of dissolved organic C, N, and P
were small (&lt; 5 %) relative to passive fluxes. The contrasting patterns of active and passive fluxes found between summer and winter could
mainly be attributed to surface warming and stratification in summer and cooling and wind-induced turbulence for pumping nutrients into the euphotic
zone in winter. In addition to seasonal variations, the impact of anticyclonic eddies and internal-wave events on enhancing active and passive
fluxes was apparent in the NSCS. Both active and passive fluxes were likely driven by nutrient availability within the euphotic zone, which was
ultimately controlled by the changes in internal and external forcings. The nutrient availability also determined the inventory of chlorophyll a
and new production, thereby allowing the estimates of active and passive fluxes for unmeasured events. To a first approximation, the South China Sea (SCS) may
effectively transfer 0.208 ± 0.089 Gt C yr−1 into the ocean's interior, accounting for approximately 1.89 ± 0.81 % of
the global C flux. The internal forcing and climatic conditions are likely critical factors in determining the seasonal and event-driven variability

This concept is demonstrated using bacterioplankton in the surface seawaters of the East China Sea.

Hsieh",Copernicus GmbH,Biogeosciences,2013,2013-8-5,"Allometric scaling of body size versus growth rate and mortality has been suggested to be a universal macroecological pattern, as described by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). However, whether such scaling generally holds in natural assemblages remains debated. Here, we test the hypothesis that the size-specific growth rate and grazing mortality scale with the body size with an exponent of −1/4 after temperature correction, as MTE predicts. To do so, we couple a dilution experiment with the FlowCAM imaging system to obtain size-specific growth rates and grazing mortality of natural microphytoplankton assemblages in the East China Sea. This novel approach allows us to achieve highly resolved size-specific measurements that would be very difficult to obtain in traditional size-fractionated measurements using filters. Our results do not support the MTE prediction. On average, the size-specific growth rates and grazing mortality scale almost isometrically with body size (with scaling exponent ∼0.1). However, this finding contains high uncertainty, as the size-scaling exponent varies substantially among assemblages. The fact that size-scaling exponent varies among assemblages prompts us to further investigate how the variation of size-specific growth rate and grazing mortality can interact to determine the microphytoplankton size structure, described by normalized biomass size spectrum (NBSS), among assemblages. We test whether the variation of microphytoplankton NBSS slopes is determined by (1) differential grazing mortality of small versus large individuals, (2) differential growth rate of small versus large individuals, or (3) combinations of these scenarios. Our results indicate that the ratio of the grazing mortality of the large size category to that of the small size category best explains the variation of NBSS slopes across environments, suggesting that higher grazing mortality of large microphytoplankton may release the small phytoplankton from grazing, which in turn leads to a steeper NBSS slope.

The biodiversity‐ecosystem functioning debate is a central topic in ecology. Recently, there has been a growing interest in size diversity because body size is sensitive to environmental changes and is one of the fundamental characteristics of organisms linking many ecosystem properties. However, how size diversity affects ecosystem functioning is an important yet unclear issue.

To fill the gap, with large‐scale field data from the East China Sea, we tested the novel hypothesis that increasing zooplankton size diversity enhances top‐down control on phytoplankton (H1) and compared it with five conventional hypotheses explaining the top‐down control: flatter zooplankton size spectrum enhances the strength of top‐down control (H2); nutrient enrichment lessens the strength of top‐down control (H3); increasing zooplankton taxonomic diversity enhances the strength of top‐down control (H4); increasing fish predation decreases the strength of top‐down control of zooplankton on phytoplankton through trophic cascade (H5); increasing temperature intensifies the strength of top‐down control (H6).

The results of univariate analyses support the hypotheses based on zooplankton size diversity (H1), zooplankton size spectrum (H2), nutrient (H3) and zooplankton taxonomic diversity (H4), but not the hypotheses based on fish predation (H5) and temperature (H6). More in‐depth analyses indicate that zooplankton size diversity is the most important factor in determining the strength of top‐down control on phytoplankton in the East China Sea.

Our results suggest a new potential mechanism that increasing predator size diversity enhances the strength of top‐down control on prey through diet niche partitioning. This mechanism can be explained by the optimal predator–prey body‐mass ratio concept. Suppose each size group of zooplankton predators has its own optimal phytoplankton prey size, increasing size diversity of zooplankton would promote diet niche partitioning of predators and thus elevates the strength of top‐down control.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12067,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True

Here, we used variation partitioning and null model analysis to compare mechanisms driving bacterial and protist metacommunity dynamics at the basin scale in the East China Sea, based on MiSeq paired-end sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 18S rDNA, respectively, in surface, deep chlorophyll maximum and bottom layers. Our analyses indicated that protist communities were governed more strongly by species sorting relative to dispersal limitation than were bacterial communities; this pattern was consistent across the three-depth layers, albeit to different degrees. Furthermore, we detected that bacteria exhibited wider habitat niche breadths than protists, whereas, passive dispersal abilities were not appreciably different between them.

Freshwater Res.,2005,2005,"Seasonal variation in hydrographic conditions in Taiwan Strait is strongly influenced by the monsoonal system. During northern winter, the China Coastal Current, pushed by the north-east (NE) monsoon, moves southwards into Taiwan Strait and during northern summer, the South China Sea Surface Current, driven by the south-west (SW) monsoon, invades the strait until the NE monsoon again prevails. As the SW monsoon wanes (in northern autumn), the Kuroshio Branch Current enters from the southern part of the strait, but stagnates in the middle because of interference by the China Coastal Current. As the NW monsoon wanes (in northern spring), the stagnation ceases and the SW monsoon begins. We characterised zooplankton (including copepods and ichthyoplankton) communities during a period when the SW monsoon was prevalent (in August), at the onset of the NE monsoon (in November) and as the NE monsoon waned (in March). Multivariate analyses of zooplankton composition and species abundances demonstrated that the structures of communities are closely related to oceanic variables (such as temperature, salinity and upwelling), which, in turn, are heavily influenced by the monsoons. The zooplankton faunas in Taiwan Strait are a mixture of local species and intruding species, the latter introduced from along the China coast during northern winter and from the South China Sea during northern summer.

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that copepod community growth rates can be described by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), linking spatio-temporal variation of copepod growth rate with temperature and their body size. Our results generally agree with predictions made by the MTE and demonstrate that weight-specific growth rates of copepod communities in our study area are positively related with temperature and negatively related to body size. However, the regression coefficients of body size do not approach the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we find that the deviation from the MTE predictions may be partly attributed to the effect of food availability (which is not explicitly accounted for by the MTE). In addition, significant difference in the coefficients of temperature and body size exists among taxonomic groups.

It can be symbiotic within rhizosolenoid hosts, including Rhizosolenia (R-R) and Guinardia (G-R), and occasionally occurs as free-living (FL-R) filaments. We investigated the Richelia abundances in the South China (SCS) and Philippine Seas (PS) during the northeast (NEM) and southwest monsoon (SWM) seasons between 2001 and 2016. Field results showed that G-R was most abundant in the SCS during the SWM. Both R-R and FL-R were more abundant in the PS than the SCS and during the SWM versus the NEM. In general, R-R were more abundant than G-R, except at the SCS-SWM stations where abundances were comparable. Multivariate statistical models indicate that as R-R and G-R were abundant in warmer seawaters, nitrate plus nitrite was a key factor negatively controlling R-R abundance while silicate was more positively related to G-R. Positive correlation between G-R and FL-R abundances and microscopic observations imply that like Rhizosolenia-associated Richelia, filaments released from Guinardia hosts can remain viable outside their diatom hosts for time periods on the order of days. Overall, results reveal different distribution patterns between the two rhizosolenoid-Richelia symbioses and both G-R and R-R likely contribute to FL-R in the field.",https://doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbab022,國立中山大學海洋科學系,托星豪,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Few quantitative methods have offered plausible ways to define the exact magnitude of the distorted sedimentary structures in imperfect sedimentary records in the context of overly limited sedimentary records. In this study, an investigation was conducted on the Kaoping slope offshore southwestern Taiwan, a region known for its high sedimentation rate (&gt; 0.9 g/cm2/year), using both the LGD-GPC (giant piston corer) and giant gravity corer techniques. To examine how GPC procedures have shaped the retrieval of sedimentary sequences and affected core quality, we apply well-developed, non-destructive analyses, including physical property measurements, visible color reflectance and digital core images with quantitative curvature index (CI), to recovered sediments. Cores at 22° 23′N, 120° 13′E were as the basis for non-destructive measurement comparison. Evidence from digital core imaging and the CI calculation further supports the mechanism of piston suction. We suggest that shear deformation of sediment against the core barrel would be the prominent factor that govern the observed core disturbances in LGD-GPC cores. Meanwhile, excessive pulling forcing from a modified TORI piston and a slowly lift speed during LGD-GPC coring process may further aggravate core disturbances at the revisited site.

The biotic and abiotic organic carbon (OC) stocks were significantly higher on the slope than in the canyon, except for the bacteria stock. The sediment oxygen utilization was similar between the two habitats, but the magnitude and distribution of the OC flow in the food web were distinctively different. Despite a significant input flux of ∼ 2020 mg C m−2 d−1 in the canyon, 84 % of the carbon flux exited the system, while 12 % was buried. On the slope, 84 % of the OC input (∼ 109 mg C m−2 d−1) was buried, and only 7 % exited the system. Bacteria processes play a major role in the carbon fluxes within the canyon. In contrast, the food web in the upper slope exhibited stronger interactions among metazoans, indicated by higher fluxes between meiofauna and macrofauna compartments. Network indices based on the LIM outputs showed that the canyon head had higher total system throughput (T..) and total system throughflow (TST), indicating greater energy flowing through the system. In contrast, the slope had a significantly higher Finn cycling index (FCI), average mutual information (AMI), and longer OC turnover time, suggesting a relatively more stable ecosystem with higher energy recycling. Due to sampling limitations, the present study only represents the benthic food web during the “dry” period. By integrating the field data into a food web model, this study provides valuable insight into the fates of OC cycling in an active submarine canyon, focusing on the often overlooked benthic communities.
